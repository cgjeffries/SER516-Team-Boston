# Project Documentation and Readme

## Scrum Application with Taiga API Integration

This project integrates with the Taiga API, facilitating scrum management and metric calculations. It features a GUI (
JavaFX) application to display Taiga information and scrum management with visualizations.

## Project Features

### Burndown Chart

The Burndown Chart feature generates visual representations of work versus time for a given sprint, utilizing Story
Points or the custom attribute "Business Value" from Taiga. This presents the user with a visual "information radiator"
for the progress of user stories and tasks against the total planned work for a sprint.

### Cycle Time

The Cycle Time feature analyzes the efficiency of the workflow process, measuring the time taken for Tasks or User
Stories to move from being started ("in-progress") to completed ("done"). This metric is visualized through a Cycle Time
scatterplot graph, offering an inverse perspective to task inertia and highlighting the speed of task completion.

### Lead Time

The Lead Time feature measures the duration from when a story or task is added to the product backlog until it is
delivered in a sprint, visualized on a Cumulative Flow Diagram (CFD). This metric helps teams understand the overall
timeline from idea inception to delivery and the efficiency of the development cycle.

### Product Backlog (PB) Change

This feature tracks and displays user stories added to the Product Backlog during an active sprint. It allows teams to
monitor scope creep and understand how additions to the backlog can impact sprint commitments and overall project
timelines.

### Product Backlog (PB) Health

The PB Health metric provides a comprehensive view of the product backlog's readiness for upcoming sprints by evaluating
the ratio of total user stories against those marked as "SprintReady". A "SprintReady" story, indicating it has been
groomed and is ready for inclusion in a sprint, helps assess the backlog's balance between preparedness and required
development effort, based on story points.

### Groom Rate

Groom Rate measures the proportion of user stories groomed (modified or updated) within a specific timeframe. This
metric highlights the team's effort in refining and estimating the backlog, crucial for maintaining an actionable and
prioritized list of user stories. It emphasizes the importance of continuous backlog grooming in agile development.

### Scope Change

Scope Change focuses on identifying user stories added to the Sprint Backlog after the sprint planning phase. This
metric is vital for understanding changes in sprint scope, helping teams to adapt and re-prioritize work effectively,
ensuring sprint goals remain achievable despite any alterations to the initially planned scope.

## Setting up the application

### Requirements and Setup

- Java 17 or higher
- Maven for dependency management and running the project
  - Maven will include JavaFX in its dependencies
- Docker
  - You will need [BuildKit](https://docs.docker.com/build/buildkit/#overview) installed. If you have Docker Desktop installed, you should already have it.

### Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ser516asu/SER516-Team-Boston.git
   cd SER516-Team-Boston
   ```

### One Punch Run Command

At the root of the project, run:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/run_deployed.sh
   ```

### Building

At the root of the project, run:

```bash
# Build the Microservices
docker-compose build
# Build the client
mvn -pl client -am -DskipTests clean install
```

Or using the convenience script under `scripts/`:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh
```

### Running

To run go to the project root and do:

```bash
# Run in detached mode
docker-compose up -d
mvn -pl client javafx:run
```

Or using the convenience script under `scripts/`:

```bash
./scripts/start.sh
```

### Stopping

At the root of the project, run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Testing the application

Run application tests with the following command

```bash
   mvn test
   ```

### Implementation and Technical Description

The project is structured to interact with the Taiga API, leveraging JavaFX for the GUI components, allowing users to
interact with the application visually. The main technical aspects include:

- API Integration: Utilizes custom API wrapper classes (UserStoryAPI, ProjectAPI, etc.) to communicate with Taiga's
  RESTful API, fetching and updating data asynchronously.
- Model Representation: Defines comprehensive model classes (UserStoryDetail, Project, etc.) that mirror the JSON
  structures returned by the Taiga API, facilitating easy data manipulation and display.
- UI Interaction: Employs JavaFX screens (MetricSelection, ProjectSelection, etc.) for navigating between different
  functionalities, such as selecting metrics, projects, and sprints.
- Utility and Helper Classes: Incorporates utility classes (UserStoryUtils, TaigaUtil, etc.) that provide methods for
  calculating metrics and performing other helper functionalities.
- Configuration and Settings Management: Manages application settings and configurations (Settings.java, AppModel.java),
  including saving and loading user preferences and project data.
