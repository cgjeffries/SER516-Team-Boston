* No more than this one branch shall be created per User Story, except as follows:
    * A major refactoring or breaking change is being made such that it would cause disruption from uncompilable code if
      the commits were made to the User Story branch directly AND the branch creator has obtained the consent of all
      those in the group.

* Branches shall be named according to the following format:
